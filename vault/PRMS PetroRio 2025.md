### FOREWORD

**Scope of Investigation**

This report presents estimates, as of January 1, 2025, of the extent of the proved, probable, and possible oil and gas reserves and the value of the proved, proved-plus-probable, and proved-plus-probable-plus-possible reserves of the Albacora Leste, Frade, Polvo, Tubarão Martelo, and Wahoo fields, located in the Campos Basin, offshore Brazil, in which PRIO S.A. (PRIO) has represented it holds an interest. This report also presents estimates of the extent and potential value of the oil and gas contingent resources of the Frade field evaluated herein. PRIO’s working interest in each reservoir of the fields, the concession expiration date, and the extension of the expiration date for each field are shown in Table 1 of this report.

PRIO has further represented that it holds a 40-percent non-operated interest in the BM-C-7 and BM-C-47 concession areas in the Campos Basin. The BM-C-7 concession contains the Peregrino field, which extends to the neighboring BM-C-47 concession, where it takes the name Pitangola. At the request of PRIO, the BM-C-7 and BM-C-47 concession areas were not evaluated herein; these areas were previously evaluated for PRIO in our report entitled "Report as of June 30, 2024 on Reserves and Revenue and Contingent Resources and Potential Revenue of the BM-C-7 and BM-C-47 Concession Areas

located offshore Brazil for PRIO S.A.” We received no information from PRIO regarding these properties after June 30, 2024.

Estimates of reserves and contingent resources presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with the Petroleum Resources Management System (PRMS) approved in March 2007 and revised in June 2018 by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the World Petroleum Council, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, the Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log Analysts, and the European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers. The reserves definitions are discussed in detail in the Definition of Reserves section of this report. The contingent resources definitions are discussed in detail in the Definition of Contingent Resources section of this report.

Reserves estimated in this report are expressed as gross reserves and net reserves. Gross reserves are defined as the total estimated petroleum remaining to be produced from these properties after December 31, 2024. Net reserves are defined as that portion of the gross reserves attributable to the evaluated interests after deducting all interests held by others, including royalties paid in kind. PRIO has represented that its government royalty obligations are paid in cash; therefore, net reserves have not been reduced in consideration of these royalty obligations.

This report presents values for proved, proved-plus-probable, and proved-plus-probable-plus-possible reserves that were estimated using prices, expenses, and costs provided by PRIO. Prices, expenses, and costs were provided in United States dollars (U.S.$), and all monetary values in this report are expressed in U.S.$. A detailed explanation of the forecast price, expense, and cost assumptions is included in the Valuation of Reserves section of this report.

Values for proved, proved-plus-probable, and proved-plus-probable-plus-possible reserves in this report are expressed in terms of future gross revenue, future net revenue, and present worth. Future gross revenue is defined as that revenue which will accrue to the evaluated interests from the production and sale of the estimated net reserves. Future net revenue is calculated by adding handling fees (if applicable) and deducting royalties paid in cash, operating expenses, capital costs, abandonment costs, and the special participation fee (SPF) from future gross revenue. Operating expenses include field operating expenses, transportation and processing expenses, and an allocation of overhead that directly relates to production activities. Capital costs include drilling and completion costs,

facilities costs, and field maintenance costs. Abandonment costs are represented by PRIO to be inclusive of those costs associated with the removal of equipment, plugging of wells, and reclamation and restoration associated with the abandonment. At the request of PRIO, future Brazilian income taxes were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates. Present worth is defined as future net revenue discounted at a specified arbitrary discount rate compounded monthly over the expected period of realization. Present worth should not be construed as fair market value because no consideration was given to additional factors that influence the prices at which properties are bought and sold. In this report, present worth values using a discount rate of 10 percent are reported in detail and values using discount rates of 5, 15, and 20 percent are reported as totals.

Contingent resources estimated in this report are expressed as gross contingent resources and net contingent resources. Gross contingent resources are defined as the total estimated petroleum that is potentially recoverable from known accumulations after December 31, 2024. Net contingent resources are defined as that portion of the gross contingent resources attributable to the interests potentially held by PRIO after deducting all interests held by others, including royalties paid in kind. PRIO has represented that its government royalty obligations are paid in cash; therefore, net contingent resources have not been reduced in consideration of these royalty obligations.

The contingent resources estimated herein are those quantities of petroleum that are potentially recoverable from known accumulations but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable. Because of the uncertainty of commerciality, the contingent resources estimated herein cannot be classified as reserves. The contingent resources estimates in this report are provided as a means of comparison to other contingent resources and do not provide a means of direct comparison to reserves. A detailed explanation of the contingent resources estimated herein is included in the Estimation of Contingent Resources section of this report.

Contingent resources quantities should not be confused with those quantities that are associated with reserves due to the additional risks involved. The quantities that might actually be recovered should they be developed may differ significantly from the estimates presented herein. There is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent resources evaluated herein.

This report presents potential values for contingent resources that were estimated using prices, expenses, and costs provided by PRIO. Prices, expenses, and costs were provided in U.S.$, and all monetary values in this report are expressed in U.S.$. A detailed explanation of the forecast price, expense, and cost assumptions is included in the Valuation of Contingent Resources section of this report.

Potential values for contingent resources in this report are expressed in terms of potential future gross revenue, potential future net revenue, and potential present worth. Potential future gross revenue is defined as that revenue which will accrue to the evaluated interests from the production and sale of the estimated net contingent resources. Potential future net revenue is calculated by deducting royalties paid in cash, operating expenses, capital costs, abandonment costs, and the SPF from potential future gross revenue. Operating expenses include field operating expenses, transportation and processing expenses, and an allocation of overhead that directly relates to production activities. Capital costs include drilling and completion costs, facilities costs, and field maintenance costs. Abandonment costs are represented by PRIO to be inclusive of those costs associated with the removal of equipment, plugging of wells, and reclamation and restoration associated with the abandonment. At the request of PRIO, future Brazilian income taxes were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates. Potential present worth is defined as potential future net revenue discounted at a specified arbitrary rate compounded monthly over the expected period of realization. Potential present worth should not be construed as fair market value because no consideration was given to additional factors that influence the prices at which properties are bought and sold. In this report, potential present worth values using a discount rate of 10 percent are reported in detail and values using discount rates of 5, 15, and 20 percent are reported as totals.

Estimates of reserves and revenue and contingent resources and potential revenue should be regarded only as estimates that may change as further production history and additional information become available. Not only are such estimates based on that information which is currently available, but such estimates are also subject to the uncertainties inherent in the application of judgmental factors in interpreting such information.

# GEOLOGY

<u>Albacora Leste Field</u>

The Albacora Leste field is located offshore Brazil in the Campos Basin, approximately 100 kilometers east of the Cabo de São Tomé (Figure 1) peninsula, in water depths of approximately 500 to 2,000 meters. The producing reservoirs of the field are found in Miocene- and Oligocene-age turbiditic sandstones and in the Early Cretaceous, pre-salt Aptian-age formations of the Lagoa Feia Group. The Albacora Leste field was discovered by Petrobras in 1986. The main reservoirs in this concession are the Miocene- and Oligocene-age turbiditic sandstones of the Albacora and Caratinga Formations. These reservoirs can be described as sandstones channel deposits and turbiditic lobes where the deformation mechanism and the trap system can be associated with salt tectonic events and lateral lithologic changes. The average porosity was estimated to range from 18 to 29 percent and average permeability was estimated to be 1,500 millidarcys.

In addition, in the area evaluated herein, the pre-salt Macabu reservoir of the Lagoa Feia Group is present where the structures in this region are associated with the initial rifting phase of the separation of Africa from South America. The structural configuration of the Albacora Leste field is controlled by northeast/southwest-trending normal faults forming a series of half-grabens aligned with these faults.

The lowermost section, commonly referred to as basement, corresponds to the Cabiúnas Formation that accumulated at the earliest stages of rifting. The formation is present regionally and is visible on seismic data collected from the Albacora Leste field. As rifting progressed, continental (lacustrine) sediments of the Atafona and Coqueiros Formations were deposited in the area. The Coqueiros sediments act as the hydrocarbon source rock for the pre-salt reservoirs. The Coqueiros Formation sediments fill half-grabens that resulted from the syndepositional rift faulting.

Near the top of the Lacustrian units is one of two major unconformities of the region. The equivalent of the Pre-Alagoas Unconformity in the Santos Basin separates the Coqueiros Formation and the overlying Macabu Formation. The post-rift sediments are typical of a transitional environment, from continental to shallow marine, as the incipient South Atlantic Ocean opened from south to north.

DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


In the Arapuça area, the Macabu Formation is the reservoir unit, consisting mainly of microbial carbonates. This formation represents the upper, post-rift sections of the Lagoa Feia Group, often referred to as sag sediments due to the slower, more uniform subsidence related to crustal cooling. This cooling occurred as the more active rifting and sea-floor spreading areas shifted further east. While there is some faulting present in these younger sediments, it lacks the fault-block rotation and exhibits smaller displacements compared to the earlier rifting phase. In certain nearby fields, a mound facies is occasionally found at the crest of deeper, more pronounced paleo-structures. When present, these facies exhibit very high reservoir quality.

At the end of the deposition of the Macabu carbonates, the region was the site of massively thick salt accumulation, likely associated with cyclic flooding and evaporation in a restricted marine environment. No further accumulation of microbial carbonates have been detected in this area of the Campos Basin after Lagoa Feia Group time.

<u>Frade Field</u> The Frade field is located offshore Brazil in the northern part of the Campos Basin about 370 kilometers northeast of the city of Rio de Janeiro (Figure 1). The field was discovered in 1986 by Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras) in water depths of about 1,200 meters.

Over a period of 80 million years, extending from the Lower Cretaceous through the Miocene, rivers from mainland Brazil flooded the Campos Basin region with clastic sediments, which accumulated above a thick layer of Lower Cretaceous salt. Subsequent deposition of younger sediment masses activated salt movement in many areas of the basin. In the area of the Frade field, this salt movement uplifted and deformed Oligocene-Miocene turbidite sandstones and shales and created structures that later became the hydrocarbon traps in the field.

The producing reservoirs of the Frade field are in the Oligo-Miocene turbidite reservoirs of the Carapebus Formation. There are five reservoir compartments in the field separated by faulting. In the sandstone reservoirs, average porosity was estimated to be between 29 and 34 percent, average permeability was estimated to be between 1.2 and 3.8 darcys, and oil gravity was estimated to range between 16 and 24 degrees API.

DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


<u>Polvo Field</u> The Polvo field is located offshore Brazil in the Campos Basin about 100 kilometers east of the city of Cabo Frio, Rio de Janeiro State (Figure 1).

In the Campos Basin, regional dip is toward the southeast, reflecting basinward dip caused by the opening of the Atlantic Ocean during the Early Cretaceous. This structural configuration is present in the Polvo field.

Basement rocks in the Campos Basin are Precambrian gneisses. As the basin began to open and fill, basalts of the Cabiúnas Formation flowed onto the metamorphic basement. The earliest sediments in the basin are lacustrine shales and carbonates of the Lagoa Feia Formation, which is the primary hydrocarbon source formation for the basin. After the original rifting period, a massive sequence of continental and marine sediments accumulated in the basin. The lower part of this sequence is made up of conglomerates and carbonates, which are subsequently covered by a thick evaporite section, composed predominantly of halite and anhydrite. Above the evaporites are mudstones and oolitic grainstones from Quissamã Formation, Macaé Group, deposited during Albian time when a broad carbonate platform developed in the region. In the Polvo field, these carbonates accumulated in shallow water paleo-environment on northeast-trending local structural highs atop basement or salt uplifts.

As basin subsidence continued, coastal rivers flooded sands into the basin. These sands were deposited in environments ranging from deepwater turbidites to shallow-water deltaic and bay-lagoon settings. This style of sedimentation continued from the Cenomanian until the Miocene. In the Polvo field, the sandstones were deposited in coastal plain, lagoon, and bay deltaic environments.

The initial drilling campaign identified several areas of Quissamã carbonate accumulation. After further evaluation, three of these areas were targeted for additional development, as follows: the Devonian-7 (3-DEV-7-RJS) and Dev-4&5 (1-DEV-4-RJS and 3-DEV-5DP-RJS) shoal areas, in the western part of the field, and the Dev-3 (1-DEV-3-RJS) shoal area, referred to herein as the East Quissamã. Six platform wells were drilled and completed as producers from the Quissamã accumulation.

DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


The Turonian and Maastrichtian sandstones were found to be well developed and productive in separate accumulations east of the Quissamã wells. This part of the field was originally known as the Guarajuba field. Currently, five wells produce from the Maastrichtian reservoir, three wells produce from the Turonian reservoir, and one well produces from the Turonian East reservoir.

The Eocene-age reservoirs are the marine sandstones of the Emborê Formation. These clastic reservoirs were originally associated with a variety of sub-environments, deepwater turbidities, and submarine fans deposited in a slope basin and shoreface marine coastal deposits. This formation was affected by salt tectonics, which contributed to the generation of normal faults and, together with the top of the salt dome, work as seals for this field. The trap system is a combination of the structure and the stratigraphic, with lateral seals from the Oligocene canyon fill deposits.

These Eocene sandstone reservoirs were tested in six wells located at the edge of local horst-graven system. Five of the wells are located in the central part of the field, while the 1-DEV-6-RJS well tested oil in the northern part of the field. The first production well began producing from the Eocene reservoir in March 2020.

Productive reservoir volumes were estimated using standard volumetric methods based on geological mapping that utilized seismic data and well logs. Structure maps were constructed for each reservoir. Isopach maps of the sandstone reservoirs were constructed using limits based on stratigraphy and structural oil/water contacts (OWC). In many of the sandstone reservoirs, the productive sands were often cut by overlying erosional unconformities that formed the northern, western, and eastern limits. The southern downdip limit was often an estimated OWC.

<u>Tubarão Martelo Field</u> The Tubarão Martelo field is located offshore Brazil in the Campos Basin about 100 kilometers southeast of Rio de Janeiro (Figure 1).

The producing reservoirs of the Tubarão Martelo field are in the Albo-Cenomanian Quissamã carbonate formation of the Macaé Group. The Quissamã Formation is the uppermost section of the Macaé Group and can be described as a very clean limestone consisting of

10
DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


mainly oolitic/oncolitic packstones and grainstones, peloidal packstones, peloidal wackestones, and peloidal/bioclastic mudstones. These high-energy shoal facies are typically deposited on structurally positive features, and are likely the result of salt movement and/or basement-involved faulting.

The high-energy shoals are the primary targets in the Quissamã Formation in the Tubarão Martelo field. The reservoir features primary porosity, likely resulting from rapid deposition, low compaction, and a lack of calcite cement precipitated early in the burial process.

The Quissamã Formation is the lowermost section of the Macaé Group and is predominantly below the OWC in the Tubarão Martelo field. The Quissamã Formation is a secondary reservoir in the Tubarão Martelo field. Reservoir quality in the Quissamã Formation is more variable than in the overlying Imbetiba Formation.

The structural configuration of the Tubarão Martelo field is a southward-dipping monocline with northeast-to-southwest, up-to-the-basin antithetic faults trending across the northern portion of the field and a down-to-the-basin normal fault forming the southern closure of the field. The down-to-the-basin normal fault on the southern flank of the field creates a local horst block. Structural dip in the Tubarão Martelo field creates a four-way closure.

Low, best, and high original oil in place (OOIP) quantities were estimated for the Tubarão Martelo field. The low OOIP estimate was areally limited to the crestal portions of the Tubarão Martelo field based on the reduction of the net-to-gross ratio seen in wells drilled on the flanks of the field. For volumetric estimation purposes, the Imbetiba and Quissamã reservoir section was subdivided into four units to account for variations in petrophysical properties. The uppermost unit represents the Imbetiba Formation and is referred to as Zone 1. The unit underlying Zone 1 is referred to as Zone 2, which represents a low-porosity interval encountered in each of the non-horizontal wells. The unit underlying Zone 2 is referred to as Zone 3, which represents the upper portion of the Quissima Formation. The lowermost reservoir unit in the field is referred to as Zone 4, which represents the lower portion of the Quissamã Formation. The majority of the oil in place in the Tubarão Martelo field is contained in Zone 1.

<u>Wahoo Field</u>

The Wahoo field is located offshore Brazil in the Campos Basin, approximately 100 kilometers due north of Rio de Janeiro (Figure 1), in water depths of approximately 1,000 to 1,500 meters.

The structure in this region is associated with the initial rifting phase of the separation of Africa from South America. The lowermost section of the syn-rift deposit is composed for the basalts of the Cabiúnas Formation, which accumulated at the earliest stages of rifting. As rifting progressed, continental (lacustrine) sediments of the Lagoa Feia Group were deposited in the area. The Coqueiros sediments act as the hydrocarbon source rock for the pre-salt reservoirs.

The producing reservoirs of the Wahoo field are the Early Cretaceous pre-salt Barremian-Aptian Macabu Formation. The Macabu Formation is made up primarily of microbial carbonates (stromatolites) and is divided into major zones denoted, from top to base, as the MCB100, MCB200, and MCB300 zones. The upper, post-rift sections of the Macabu carbonates are often referred to as sag sediments because of the slower, more uniform subsidence of the area related to crustal cooling that occurred as the more active rifting and sea-floor spreading areas moved further east. There is some faulting in these younger sediments, but without the fault-block rotation and with smaller displacements than are observed in faulting associated with the earlier phase of rifting.

The Wahoo field can be described as a north-south structural high with multiple north-south transpressional trend faults. These structural highs are associated with carbonate buildups constructed by microbial activity generating closure on four sides. The field limits are formed by structural dip. Due to the tectonic stress and the fault interpretation, the Top Macabu reservoir in the Wahoo field could be compartmentalized in at least two segments (East and West). The OWC was identified in the discovery well at an estimated depth of 4,840 meters true vertical depth subsea (TVDSS). Additionally, a pressure gradient plot from well data shows a potential OWC at an estimated depth of 4,850 meters TVDSS.

Five wells have been drilled in the Wahoo field. The Wahoo-1-APL-1-ESS discovery well was drilled in 2008, south of the structural high on the west flank of the field. This well found approximately 100 meters of gross thickness and 59 meters of net pay. In 2009, the APL-2DA-ESS

DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


and 1-APL-2-ESS wells were drilled on the north part of the structure to define the northern limit of the field. The drilling campaign was completed with the 3-APL-6-ESS and 3-APL-7D-ESS wells, which are located in the central and northwest parts of the field, respectively.

A structural interpretation provided by PRIO was accepted as the structural framework and used in the geocelular model constructed to estimate the OOIP. Effective porosity (PHIE) and water saturation (S<sub>w</sub>) petrophysical properties were propagated in the three-dimensional (3–D) model. The net-to-gross properties were defined as $\ge$ 5 percent, $\ge$ 3 percent, and $\ge$ 2 percent PHIE for the proved, proved-plus-probable, and proved-plus-probable-plus-possible reserves scenarios, respectively. The average PHIE ranges between 10 and 11 percent and the average S<sub>w</sub> ranges between 17 and 20 percent for the estimated OOIP. The estimated OWC observed in the discovery well (4,840 meters TVDSS) was used for estimating the OOIP associated with the proved and proved-plus-probable categories, while the estimated OWC observed on the pressure gradient plot (4,850 meters TVDSS) was used for the proved-plus-probable-plus-possible category.

# **DEFINITION of RESERVES**

Estimates of proved, probable, and possible reserves presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with the PRMS approved in March 2007 and revised in June 2018 by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the World Petroleum Council, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, the Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log Analysts, and the European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers. The petroleum reserves are defined as follows:

Reserves are those quantities of petroleum anticipated to be commercially recoverable by application of development projects to known accumulations from a given date forward under defined conditions. Reserves must satisfy four criteria: discovered, recoverable, commercial, and remaining (as of the evaluation’s effective date) based on the development project(s) applied. Reserves are further categorized in accordance with the level of certainty associated with the estimates and may be sub-classified based on project maturity and/or characterized by development and production status.

> *Proved Reserves* are those quantities of petroleum that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under defined economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. If deterministic methods are used, the term “reasonable certainty” is intended to express a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90% probability (P90) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate.
>
> *Probable Reserves* are those additional Reserves which analysis of geoscience and engineering data indicate are less likely to be recovered than Proved Reserves but more certain to be recovered than Possible Reserves. It is equally likely that actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater than or less than the sum of the estimated Proved plus Probable Reserves (2P). In this context, when probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability [P50] that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the 2P estimate.

DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON

> *Possible Reserves* are those additional reserves that analysis of geoscience and engineering data indicates are less likely to be recoverable than Probable Reserves. The total quantities ultimately recovered from the project have a low probability to exceed the sum of Proved plus Probable plus Possible (3P), which is equivalent to the high-estimate scenario. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10% probability (P10) that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the 3P estimate.

Once projects satisfy commercial maturity, the associated quantities are classified as Reserves. These quantities may be allocated to the following subdivisions based on the funding and operational status of wells and associated facilities within the reservoir development plan:

> *Developed Reserves* are quantities expected to be recovered from existing wells and facilities. Reserves are considered developed only after the necessary equipment has been installed, or when the costs to do so are relatively minor compared to the cost of a well. Where required facilities become unavailable, it may be necessary to reclassify Developed Reserves as Undeveloped. Developed Reserves may be further sub-classified as Producing or Non-Producing.
>
>> *Developed Producing Reserves* are expected quantities to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the effective date of the estimate. Improved recovery Reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation.
>
>> *Developed Non-Producing Reserves* include shut-in and behind-pipe reserves. Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from (1) completion intervals that are open at the time of the estimate but which have not yet started producing, (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections, or (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons. Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells that will require additional completion work or future re-completion before start of production with minor cost to access these reserves. In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well.

15
DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


> *Undeveloped Reserves* are quantities expected to be recovered through future significant investments. Undeveloped Reserves are to be produced (1) from new wells on undrilled acreage in known accumulations, (2) from deepening existing wells to a different (but known) reservoir, (3) from infill wells that will increase recovery, or (4) where a relatively large expenditure (e.g., when compared to the cost of drilling a new well) is required to (a) recomplete an existing well or (b) install production or transportation facilities for primary or improved recovery projects.

The extent to which probable and possible reserves ultimately may be recategorized as proved reserves is dependent upon future drilling, testing, and well performance. The degree of risk to be applied in evaluating probable and possible reserves is influenced by economic and technological factors as well as the time element. Estimates of probable and possible reserves in this report have not been adjusted in consideration of these additional risks to make them comparable to estimates of proved reserves.

# ESTIMATION of RESERVES

Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry and in accordance with definitions established by the PRMS. The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history.

Based on the current stage of field development, production performance, the development plan provided by PRIO, and analyses of areas offsetting existing wells with test or production data, reserves were categorized as proved, probable, or possible.

The undeveloped reserves estimates were based on opportunities identified in the plan of development provided by PRIO. Developed non-producing reserves include those quantities associated with behind-pipe zones and include minor remaining capital expenditure as compared to the cost of a new well.

PRIO has represented that its senior management is committed to the development plan provided by PRIO and that PRIO has the financial capability to execute the development plan, including the drilling and completion of wells and the installation of equipment and facilities.

When applicable, the volumetric method was used to estimate the OOIP. Structure maps were prepared to delineate each reservoir, and isopach maps were constructed to estimate reservoir volume. Electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, and other available data were used to prepare these maps as well as to estimate representative values for porosity and water saturation.

Estimates of ultimate recovery were obtained after applying recovery factors to OOIP. These recovery factors were based on consideration of the type of energy inherent in the reservoirs, analyses of the petroleum, the structural positions of the properties, and the production histories. When applicable, material balance and other engineering methods were used to estimate recovery factors based on an analysis of reservoir performance, including production rate, reservoir pressure, and reservoir fluid properties.

17
DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


For depletion-type reservoirs or those whose performance disclosed a reliable decline in producing-rate trends or other diagnostic characteristics, reserves were estimated by the application of appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. In the analyses of production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limits of economic production as defined in the Definition of Reserves section of this report or the expiration of the concession, as appropriate.

In certain cases, reserves were estimated by incorporating elements of analogy with similar wells or reservoirs for which more complete data were available.

For cases where history-matched dynamic models were available and applicable, model results were used to estimate recovery factors and reserves production forecasts.

Data provided by PRIO from wells drilled through December 31, 2024, and made available for this evaluation were used to prepare the reserves estimates herein. These reserves estimates were based on consideration of monthly production data available through December 2024. Cumulative production, as of December 31, 2024, was deducted from the estimated gross ultimate recovery to estimate gross reserves.

Oil reserves estimated herein are to be recovered by normal field separation and are expressed in thousands of barrels (10<sup>3</sup>bbl). In these estimates, 1 barrel equals 42 United States gallons.

Gas quantities estimated herein are expressed as sales gas. Sales gas is defined as the total gas to be produced from the reservoirs, measured at the point of delivery, after reduction for fuel usage, flare, and shrinkage resulting from field separation and processing. Gas reserves estimated herein are reported as sales gas. Gas quantities are expressed at a temperature base of 20 degrees Celsius (°C) and at a pressure base of 1 atmosphere. Gas quantities included in this report are expressed in millions of cubic feet (10<sup>6</sup>ft<sup>3</sup>).

Gas quantities are identified by the type of reservoir from which the gas will be produced. Nonassociated gas is gas at initial reservoir conditions with no oil present in the reservoir. Associated gas is both gas-cap gas and solution gas. Gas-cap gas is gas at initial reservoir conditions and is in communication with an underlying oil zone. Solution gas is gas dissolved in oil at

18
DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


initial reservoir conditions. Gas quantities estimated herein include only associated gas in the form of solution gas.

<u>Albacora Leste Field</u>

The Albacora Leste field was discovered by Petrobras in March 1986 with the drilling of the 1-RJS-342-RJ exploratory well in the Albacora Sandstone reservoir. Oil production began in June 1998 using an early connection of the 4-RJS-477A-RJS well, drilled in 1993, to the P-25 production platform in the neighboring Albacora field. The well produced for more than 4 years until September 2002, when it was shut in. The field began continual operations in 2006 through the operation of the P-50 floating production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO). In February 2007, the field reached peak oil production at a rate of approximately 172,000 barrels per day of oil. In 2014, oil was discovered in the Macabu Carbonate pre-salt reservoir through the drilling of the 6-ABL-85-RJS exploratory well. A total of 18 production wells and 15 water injection wells are currently tied in to the P-50 FPSO.

As represented by PRIO, the concession extension for the Albacora Leste field was granted in 2022 by the Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombistíveis (ANP) to Petrobras, the previous owner of the interests and operator of the field. PRIO has further represented that the current concession expiration date is December 31, 2031. However, PRIO has advised that it has reasonable certainty that an additional extension of the concession will be obtained to ensure that the Albacora Leste field can be produced to its economic limit based on PRIO’s represented development plan. In Brazil, a concession extension is granted as determined by the ANP if certain conditions are met by the company operating the concession. PRIO has represented that it will meet the conditions required by the ANP to obtain the concession extension. Based on PRIO’s representations, reserves presented herein for the Albacora Leste field were estimated based on the development plan provided to the economic limit as defined in the Definition of Reserves section of this report and with one additional concession extension until August 6, 2052.

PRIO has represented that certain reservoirs that straddle different license areas are under the terms of a unitization agreement for joint development. Based on PRIO’s representation, certain reservoirs in the Albacora Leste field straddle the neighboring Albacora field (to the west) and Roncador field (to the north). The unitization factors provided by PRIO were considered for the reserves estimated herein.

19
DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


Proved developed producing reserves were estimated for existing wells by the application of appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships, primarily the semi-logarithmic plots of oil rate versus time trends and the Cartesian plot of oil rate versus cumulative oil trends. PRIO provided a plan of development for the Albacora Leste field. This development plan included a total of five proved undeveloped production wells and one proved undeveloped injection well in the Albacora-140 reservoir, five proved undeveloped production wells and three proved undeveloped injection wells in the Albacora-210 reservoir, one proved undeveloped production well in Caratinga reservoir, and two proved undeveloped production wells and one proved undeveloped injection well in the Macabu pre-salt reservoir. In addition, three proved undeveloped completion and tie-in or workover activities were considered for the existing ABL-8H (AB-140 reservoir), ABL-60 (AB-140), and ABL-85 (Macabu) wells. Proved undeveloped reserves were also estimated associated with a project to improve the efficiency of the P-50 FPSO. Proved developed non-producing reserves were estimated for intervention jobs to be performed on four production wells and one injection well in the AB-140 reservoir, and one production well in the CRT-200 reservoir. Reserves for the field evaluated herein were based on PRIO’s representation of planned future activity. Probable and possible reserves were also estimated for the Albacora Leste field for wells, as applicable, associated with incremental recovery above quantities estimated for proved and probable reserves, respectively.

<u>Frade Field</u> The Frade field was discovered by Petrobras in 1986, and Chevron and its partners began development activities in 2008. Oil production began in June 2009 using a subsea gathering system connected to a FPSO. A total of 11 horizontal production wells and 5 vertical water injection wells have been drilled since 2008, as well as several pilot boreholes. Water injection started in July 2010, but was suspended in November 2011 due to a pressure kick that occurred when drilling one of the wells. Production was suspended in March 2012 due to oil seeps interpreted to be associated with fractures connecting to the sea floor that are believed to have been opened by localized higher pressures near the injection wells. Production was restarted in April 2013; 11 wells were on production and 3 water injection wells were operational at the end of December 2024.

As represented by PRIO, the concession extension was granted by the ANP in 2016 contingent on the current drilling campaign, which was approved by the ANP in 2021 and started in 2022. PRIO has further represented that the current concession expiration date for the Frade field

20
DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


is December 31, 2041. However, PRIO has advised that it has reasonable certainty that an additional extension of the concession will be obtained once the Wahoo field is connected to the Frade field FPSO to ensure that the field can be produced to its economic limit based on PRIO’s represented development plan. In Brazil, a concession extension is granted as determined by ANP if certain conditions are met by the company operating the concession. Based on PRIO’s representations, reserves presented herein for the Frade field were estimated based on the development plan provided to the economic limit as defined in the Definition of Reserves section of this report and with one additional concession extension until August 6, 2052.

Proved developed producing reserves were estimated for existing wells by the application of appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships, primarily the semi-logarithmic plots of oil rate versus time trends and the Cartesian plot of oil rate versus cumulative oil trends. Proved developed non-producing reserves were estimated for intervention jobs to be performed on two production wells (OUP1 and OUP3). Proved undeveloped reserves were estimated for one workover activity in the ODP3 well and for one future production well based on analogy with historical performance. Probable and possible reserves were also estimated for the Frade field for wells, as applicable, associated with incremental recovery above quantities estimated for proved and probable reserves, respectively.

### Polvo Field

The Polvo field was discovered by Petrobras with the drilling of the 1-RJS-486A-RJ well. In 2000, during the ANP’s second licensing round, the BM-C-8 Block concession containing the Polvo field was awarded to Devon Energy do Brasil Ltda. (Devon) and its partners. Devon continued field delineation drilling and development.

PRIO has represented that the concession for the BM-C-8 Block expires on December 31, 2033. However, PRIO has advised that it has reasonable certainty that an extension of the concession will be obtained to ensure that the field can be produced to its economic limit based on PRIO’s represented development plan. In Brazil, a concession extension is granted as determined by ANP if certain conditions are met by the company operating the concession. Based on PRIO’s representations, reserves presented herein for the Polvo field were estimated based on the development plan provided to the economic limit as defined in the Definitions of Reserves section of this report and with one concession extension until July 1, 2059.

21
DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


Production commenced from the Polvo field in August 2007. The average gravity of the oil produced from the Polvo field is 21 degrees API. The producing gas-oil ratio in the field is approximately 100 cubic feet per barrel, and all produced gas is either used as fuel or flared. Water depth in the Polvo field ranges from 90 to 250 meters. The field was developed with a drilling/production platform and was connected to the OSX-3 FPSO in the neighboring Tubarão Martelo field in 2021. All producing wells are horizontal/highly deviated and are completed with electric submersible pumps (ESP).

For the Polvo field, the volumetric method was used to estimate the OOIP. Proved developed producing reserves were estimated using performance-based methods, primarily decline-curve analysis of oil rate production versus time trends of individual wells. Proved undeveloped reserves were estimated for two future production wells (Pol-A and Pol-B). Reserves associated with the future Pol-A and Pol-B well locations that are planned to target an Eocene reservoir were estimated based on analogy and numerical simulation. A 3–D sector model was developed for the Eocene undeveloped well locations to run in a black-oil simulator to aid in estimating ultimate oil recovery, potential production profiles, and recovery factors. Probable and possible reserves were also estimated for the Polvo field for wells, as applicable, associated with incremental recovery above quantities estimated for proved and probable reserves, respectively.

No gas reserves were estimated for the Polvo field, since PRIO has represented that there are no plans for gas sales.

**Tubarão Martelo Field**

The Tubarão Martelo field was discovered in 2010 by OGX Petróleo e Gás Participações S.A. (OGX) with the drilling of the 1-OGX-25-RJS well in the BM-C-39 Block concession. Approval for the Tubarão Martelo development plan was granted by the ANP in July 2013 and initial oil production commenced in December 2013.

PRIO has represented that in February 2020 it acquired the interest previously held by OGX in the Tubarão Martelo field and that the concession for the BM-C-39 Block expires on April 19, 2039. However, PRIO has advised that it has reasonable certainty that an extension of the concession will be obtained to ensure that the Tubarão Martelo field can be produced to its economic limit based on PRIO’s represented development plan. In Brazil, a concession extension is granted as determined by ANP if certain conditions

22
DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


are met by the company operating the concession. Based on PRIO’s representations, reserves presented herein for the Tubarão Martelo field were estimated based on the development plan provided to the economic limit as defined in the Definitions of Reserves section of this report and with one concession extension until April 19, 2066.

For the Tubarão Martelo field, the volumetric method was used to estimate the OOIP. Proved developed producing reserves were estimated using performance-based methods, primarily decline-curve analysis of oil rate production versus time trends of individual wells. Proved developed non-producing reserves were estimated for intervention jobs to be performed on two production wells (TBMT-4HP and TBMT-10HP). Proved undeveloped reserves were estimated to be zero. Probable undeveloped reserves were estimated for two future well locations, Pepe and Joatinga, based on analogy with historical performance of nearby wells producing from the same reservoir and considering the estimated drainage areas. Probable and possible reserves were also estimated for the Tubarão Martelo field for wells, as applicable, associated with incremental recovery above quantities estimated for proved and probable reserves, respectively.

No gas reserves were estimated for the Tubarão Martelo field, since PRIO has represented that there are no plans for gas sales.

**Wahoo Field**

The Wahoo field was discovered by a group led by Anadarko in 2009 with the drilling of the 1-APL-1 well. The Wahoo field is located in the BM-C-30 Block concession at a water depth of approximately 1,400 meters.

PRIO has represented that the exploitation license was granted in 2022. PRIO has further represented that the current concession expiration date for the BM-C-30 Block is December 12, 2048. However, PRIO has advised that it has reasonable certainty that an extension of the concession will be obtained once the Wahoo field is connected to Frade’s FPSO to ensure that the field can be produced to its economic limit based on PRIO’s represented development plan. In Brazil, a concession extension is granted as determined by ANP if certain conditions are met by the company operating the concession. Based on PRIO’s representations, reserves presented herein for the Wahoo field were estimated based on the development plan provided and to the

23
DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


economic limit as defined in the Definition of Reserves section of this report or the expiration date of the extension of the concession, whichever occurs first. The development plan for the Wahoo field consists of subsea infrastructure with four producers and two water injectors tied back with a multi-phase pipeline to the Frade field FPSO located approximately 35 kilometers to the south.

For the Wahoo field, the volumetric method was used to estimate the OOIP. Proved undeveloped reserves were estimated for four vertical production wells at the crest of the structure and for two vertical water injection wells based on analogy and numerical simulation. A 3–D sector model was developed for the Wahoo field undeveloped well locations to run in a black-oil simulator to aid in estimating ultimate oil recovery, potential production profiles, and recovery factors. Probable and possible reserves were also estimated for the Wahoo field for wells, as applicable, associated with incremental recovery above quantities estimated for proved and probable reserves, respectively.

Table 2 presents a summary of the gross and net reserves for the Albacora Leste, Frade, Polvo, Tubarão Martelo, and Wahoo fields evaluated herein. Projections of gross proved developed producing, proved developed, proved undeveloped, total proved, proved-plus-probable, and proved-plus-probable-plus-possible reserves are presented by field in Tables 8 through 12.

# VALUATION of RESERVES

Revenue values in this report were estimated using forecast prices, expenses, and costs provided by PRIO.

In this report, values for proved, proved-plus-probable, and proved-plus-probable-plus-possible reserves were based on projections of estimated future production and revenue prepared for these properties with no risk adjustment applied to the probable or possible reserves. Probable and possible reserves involve substantially higher risk than proved reserves. Revenue values associated with proved-plus-probable and proved-plus-probable-plus-possible reserves have not been adjusted to account for such risks; this adjustment would be necessary in order to make values associated with probable and possible reserves comparable to values associated with proved reserves.

Future net revenue was estimated in accordance with the government of Brazil’s Petroleum Law nº 9,478, the Petroleum Law of 1997. The fiscal terms outlined in the Petroleum Law of 1997 and assessable to PRIO, as well as other economic assumptions used in this evaluation, are presented as follows:

### *Brazilian Fiscal Terms*

> The Petroleum Law of 1997 affords the Brazilian government three elements of government take: 1) petroleum levies consisting of royalties, a special participation fee, and surface rentals; 2) direct taxes, which are levied through the financial transaction tax, the corporate income tax, and two social contribution taxes; and 3) indirect taxes, which are levies on equipment and services used by companies engaged in exploration and production activities. Indirect tax levies for which PRIO may be responsible were not included in the estimates of operating expenses and capital costs. Certain indirect levies are eligible for reimbursement from sales of refined products. The reimbursement of the indirect levies from refined product sales was not accounted for in this evaluation.

25
DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


*Royalties*

The federal royalty rate in Brazil varies by field between 5 and 10 percent. PRIO provided a federal royalty rate of 10 percent for the Frade and Wahoo fields. The federal royalty rates for the Polvo, Tubarão Martelo, and Albacora Leste fields were updated in 2021 and 2022, respectively, to incur a royalty rate of 10 percent on a portion of the oil production equal to or under a field baseline oil production forecast; any additional oil production volumes in the year incur reduced royalty rates of 5 percent for the Polvo and Tubarão Martelo fields and 7.5 percent or 5 percent for the Albacora Leste field. PRIO has represented that these royalties are paid in cash.

Oil royalties are assessed on a valuation as determined by the ANP. Gas royalties are levied on a valuation, as determined by the ANP, of the total gas production less gas injected.

*Special Participation Fee*

The special participation fee (SPF) is a tax assessed at the field level on a sliding-scale basis that varies depending on the location of the field (onshore or offshore), water depth, level of production, and number of years on production. The tax basis for the SPF is similar to the tax basis for corporation income tax (CIT) with some exceptions. The depreciation methods are different for the SPF and the CIT. An annual provision for abandonment costs is also deductible for the SPF. In years in which the SPF is paid, an additional 1-percent research and development fee is assessed.

*Surface Rental Fees*

Rental fees are payable to the ANP and vary by field, depending on stage of activity (exploration or development), geological characteristics, and the location of the sedimentary basin. The surface rental fees are included herein in the estimates of field operating expenses.

26
DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


### Corporate Income Tax

At the request of PRIO, Brazilian income taxes were not considered in this evaluation.

### Social Contribution Taxes

Two social contribution taxes are levied on the market value of oil and gas sales. The Contribution for the Worker’s Social Integration Program (PIS) is assessed at a rate of 1.65 percent and the Contribution for Social Security Funding (COFINS) is levied at a 7.6-percent rate. At the request of PRIO, these taxes were not considered in the estimates of future net revenue included herein.

### Oil Price

PRIO provided the oil price forecasts, based on a Brent reference price of U.S.$62.00 per barrel, for the Albacora Leste, Frade, Polvo, Tubarão Martelo, and Wahoo fields as shown in the table below, expressed in United States dollars per barrel (U.S.$/bbl):

### Gas Price

PRIO provided a gas price of U.S.$2.31 per thousand cubic feet for the Albacora Leste, Frade, and Wahoo fields.

### Operating Expenses, Capital Costs, and Abandonment Costs

Operating expenses for the fields evaluated herein were provided by PRIO and were represented to include all costs associated with the operation and maintenance of the equipment and personnel and included surface rental fees. PRIO has represented that the provided capital expenditures for the drilling, completion, and subsea tie-in operations of

27
DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


the undeveloped production and injection wells in the Albacora Leste field are lower than the historical capital expenditures of the wells in the field. PRIO has identified cost savings based on its experience in drilling deepwater wells in the analogous Frade field and based on its recent acquisition of a drilling rig that will reduce the costs of drilling new wells. PRIO has represented that the estimates of future capital expenditures took into consideration the cost reductions associated with the acquisition of a drilling rig. Future capital expenditures, provided by PRIO, were estimated using 2024 values and were not adjusted for inflation. Abandonment costs, which are those costs associated with the removal of equipment, plugging of wells, and reclamation and restoration associated with the abandonment, were based on information provided by PRIO. Abandonment costs for the Albacora Leste, Frade, Polvo, Tubarão Martelo, and Wahoo fields were included in the year following cessation of production or in the year of the concession expiration. As represented by PRIO, the abandonment costs associated with the Polvo field reflect the remaining balance payable to the abandonment fund. Estimates of operating expenses, capital costs, and abandonment costs were considered, as appropriate, in determining the economic viability of the developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves estimated herein.

### *Handling Fee*

PRIO has represented that a handling fee of U.S.$8.0 per barrel of oil is charged to the other interest owners of the unitized reservoirs of the Albacora Leste field as a reimbursement for processing the hydrocarbons at the P-50 FPSO.

### *Exchange Rate*

Prices, expenses, costs, and revenue included herein were estimated in U.S.$. Certain operating costs paid in Brazilian reais were converted to U.S.$ by PRIO.

Estimates of contingent resources presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with the PRMS approved in March 2007 and revised in June 2018 by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the World Petroleum Council, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, the Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log Analysts, and the European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers. Because of the lack of commerciality or sufficient development drilling, the contingent resources estimated herein cannot be classified as reserves. The petroleum contingent resources are classified as follows:

> *Contingent Resources* are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations by application of development projects, but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable owing to one or more contingencies.

Contingent Resources are further categorized in accordance with the level of certainty associated with the estimates and may be sub-classified based on project maturity and/or characterized by the economic status.

> *Economically Viable Contingent Resources* are those quantities associated with technically feasible projects where cash flows are positive under reasonably forecast conditions but are not Reserves because it does not meet the other commercial criteria.
>
> *Economically Not Viable Contingent Resources* are those quantities for which development projects are not expected to yield positive cash flows under reasonable forecast conditions. May also be subject to additional unsatisfied contingencies.

Where evaluations are incomplete and it is premature to clearly define the associated cash flows, it is acceptable to note that the project economic status is "undetermined."

The estimation of petroleum resources is subject to both technical and commercial uncertainties and, in general, may be quoted as a range. The range of uncertainty reflects a reasonable range of estimated

30
DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


potentially recoverable quantities. In all cases, the range of uncertainty is dependent on the amount and quality of both technical and commercial data that are available and may change as more data become available.

> *1C (Low), 2C (Best), and 3C (High) Estimates* – Estimates of contingent resources in this report are expressed using the terms 1C (low) estimate, 2C (best) estimate, and 3C (high) estimate to reflect the range of uncertainty.

# ESTIMATION of CONTINGENT RESOURCES

Estimates of contingent resources were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry and in accordance with definitions established by the PRMS. The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history.

Based on the current stage of field development, production performance, the development plans provided by PRIO, and analyses of areas offsetting existing wells with test or production data, contingent resources were categorized as 1C, 2C, or 3C.

When applicable, the volumetric method was used to estimate the OOIP. Structure maps were prepared to delineate each reservoir, and isopach maps were constructed to estimate reservoir volume. Electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, and other available data were used to prepare these maps as well as to estimate representative values for porosity and water saturation.

Estimates of ultimate recovery were obtained after applying recovery factors to OOIP. These recovery factors were based on consideration of the type of energy inherent in the reservoirs, analyses of the petroleum, the structural positions of the properties, and the production histories. When applicable, other engineering methods were used to estimate recovery factors. In such cases, an analysis of reservoir performance, including production rate, reservoir pressure, and gas-oil ratio behavior, was used in the estimation of contingent resources.

For depletion-type reservoirs or those whose performance disclosed a reliable decline in producing-rate trends or other diagnostic characteristics, contingent resources were estimated by the application of appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. In the analyses of production-decline curves, contingent resources were estimated to the anticipated technical limits of production.

32
DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


In certain cases, contingent resources were estimated by incorporating elements of analogy with similar wells or reservoirs for which more complete data were available.

In the evaluation of contingent resources associated with future activities, type-well analysis was performed using well data from analogous reservoirs for which more complete historical performance data were available.

Data provided by PRIO from wells drilled through December 31, 2024, and made available for this evaluation were used to prepare the contingent resources estimates herein. These contingent resources estimates were based on consideration of monthly production data available through December 2024. The development and economic status represents the status applicable on December 31, 2024.

Oil contingent resources estimated herein are to be recovered by normal field separation and are expressed in thousands of barrels (10<sup>3</sup>bbl). In these estimates, 1 barrel equals 42 United States gallons.

Gas quantities associated with contingent resources estimated herein are expressed as sales gas contingent resources. Sales gas is defined as the total gas to be produced from the reservoirs, measured at the point of delivery, after reduction for fuel usage, flare, and shrinkage resulting from field separation and processing. Gas quantities are expressed at a temperature base of 20 °C and at a pressure base of 1 atmosphere. Gas quantities included in this report are expressed in millions of cubic feet (10<sup>6</sup>ft<sup>3</sup>).

Gas quantities are identified by the type of reservoir from which the gas will be produced. Nonassociated gas is gas at initial reservoir conditions with no oil present in the reservoir. Associated gas is both gas-cap gas and solution gas. Gas-cap gas is gas at initial reservoir conditions and is in communication with an underlying oil zone. Solution gas is gas dissolved in oil at initial reservoir conditions. Gas quantities estimated herein include only associated gas in the form of solution gas.

The contingent resources estimated herein are those quantities of petroleum that are potentially recoverable from known accumulations but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable. Because of the uncertainty of commerciality, the contingent resources

33
DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON


estimated herein cannot be classified as reserves. The contingent resources estimates in this report are provided as a means of comparison to other contingent resources and do not provide a means of direct comparison to reserves. The contingent resources estimated herein have an economic status of economically viable. The key contingency identified for the contingent resources estimated herein is the lack of an approved development plan.

The contingent resources estimated herein are associated with three production wells (Maracanã, ODP-6, and one infill well) to be drilled in the Frade field, with the production tails after the expiration of the license extension of the Frade field, and with the production tails of the Wahoo field that become economically viable with the execution of the contingent resources activities in the Frade field. No contingent resources projects were evaluated for the Albacora Leste, Polvo, and Tubarão Martelo fields.

Table 28 presents a summary of the gross and net contingent resources for the Albacora Leste, Frade, Polvo, Tubarão Martelo, and Wahoo fields evaluated herein.

# VALUATION OF CONTINGENT RESOURCES

Potential revenue values in this report were estimated using forecast prices, expenses, and costs provided by PRIO.

Based on information provided by PRIO, the economic assumptions described in the Valuation of Reserves section of this report were used to estimate the potential future net revenue of contingent resources and recategorized recoverable resources. At the request of PRIO, the potential revenue associated with contingent resources and that associated with recategorized recoverable resources estimated in this report are reported as a sum.

Recategorized recoverable resources estimated in this report are associated with the potential extension of the economic lives of the properties with the execution of the contingent resources infill drilling project in the Frade field. For the purposes of this report, 1C(R), 2C(R), and 3C(R) recategorized recoverable resources are defined as the portion of the technical forecasts associated with proved, proved-plus-probable, and proved-plus-probable-plus-possible reserves, respectively, that would become economically viable with the development of the contingent resources of the properties as presented herein. Estimates of the extent and potential value of recategorized recoverable resources were based on definitions and assumptions similar to those utilized to estimate the extent and potential value of the contingent resources estimated herein.

The estimated potential present worth of the contingent resources plus recategorized recoverable resources evaluated in this report is to be used for comparison and ranking of these contingent resources plus recategorized recoverable resources against other such resources only. The estimated potential present worth for the contingent resources plus recategorized recoverable resources cannot be compared directly to, equated with, or aggregated with the present worth estimates that could be realized from reserves, nor are these potential present worth estimates an assessment of the fair market value of the properties evaluated herein.

Table 29 presents a summary of the gross and net recategorized recoverable resources for the Albacora Leste, Frade, Polvo, Tubarão Martelo, and Wahoo fields evaluated herein. At the request of PRIO, projections of the estimated potential future net revenue from the net reserves plus

net contingent resources plus recategorized recoverable resources are presented for the Frade and Wahoo economic unit in Tables 30 through 32.

Notes:
1. Estimates of potential values associated with contingent resources resources do not provide a direct comparison to the values associated with reserves.
2. The contingent resources and recategorized recoverable resources evaluated herein have an economic status of Economically Viable. However, in order to reclassify contingent resources or recategorized recoverable resources as reserves, certain contingencies need to be resolved; therefore there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce the contingent resources or recategorized recoverable resources evaluated herein.
3. Future social contribution taxes and corporate incomes taxes were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates.

While the oil and gas industry may be subject to regulatory changes from time to time that could affect an industry participant's ability to recover its reserves, we are not aware of any such governmental actions which would restrict the recovery of the January 1, 2025, estimated reserves.

**Notes:**
1. Future social contribution taxes and corporate incomes taxes were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates.
2. SPF = Special Participation Fee.
3. Operating expenses and capital costs do not include the indirect taxation that may be applicable to these expenditures.
4. The estimated economic limit for the field occurs after the expiration date of the concession agreement. PRIO has represented that it expects to meet the conditions required by the ANP to obtain the concession extension. Based on this representation, and at PRIO's request, the reserves estimated herein considered the potential concession extension for the field.
5. PRIO has represented that a handling fee of U.S.$8.0 per barrel of oil is charged to the interest owners of the unitized reservoirs of the Albacora Leste field as a reimbursement for processing the hydrocarbons at the P-50 FPSO.

**Notes:**
1. Future social contribution taxes and corporate incomes taxes were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates.
2. SPF = Special Participation Fee.
3. Operating expenses and capital costs do not include the indirect taxation that may be applicable to these expenditures.
4. The estimated economic limit for the field occurs after the expiration date of the concession agreement. PRIO has represented that it expects to meet the conditions required by the ANP to obtain the concession extension. Based on this representation, and at PRIO's request, the reserves estimated herein considered the potential concession extension for the field.
5. PRIO has represented that a handling fee of U.S.$8.0 per barrel of oil is charged to the interest owners of the unitized reservoirs of the Albacora Leste field as a reimbursement for processing the hydrocarbons at the P-50 FPSO.

**Notes:**
1. Future social contribution taxes and corporate incomes taxes were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates.
2. SPF = Special Participation Fee.
3. Operating expenses and capital costs do not include the indirect taxation that may be applicable to these expenditures.
4. The estimated economic limit for the field occurs after the expiration date of the concession agreement. PRIO has represented that it expects to meet the conditions required by the ANP to obtain the concession extension. Based on this representation, and at PRIO's request, the reserves estimated herein considered the potential concession extension for the field.
5. PRIO has represented that a handling fee of U.S.$8.0 per barrel of oil is charged to the interest owners of the unitized reservoirs of the Albacora Leste field as a reimbursement for processing the hydrocarbons at the P-50 FPSO.

**Notes:**
1. Probable reserves and values for probable reserves have not been risk adjusted to make them comparable to proved reserves and values for proved reserves.
2. Future social contribution taxes and corporate incomes taxes were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates.
3. SPF = Special Participation Fee.
4. Operating expenses and capital costs do not include the indirect taxation that may be applicable to these expenditures.
5. The estimated economic limit for the field occurs after the expiration date of the concession agreement. PRIO has represented that it expects to meet the conditions required by the ANP to obtain the concession extension. Based on this representation, and at PRIO's request, the reserves estimated herein considered the potential concession extension for the field.
6. PRIO has represented that a handling fee of U.S.$8.0 per barrel of oil is charged to the interest owners of the unitized reservoirs of the Albacora Leste field as a reimbursement for processing the hydrocarbons at the P-50 FPSO.

**Notes:**
1. Probable and possible reserves and values for probable and possible reserves have not been risk adjusted to make them comparable to proved reserves and values for proved reserves.
2. Future social contribution taxes and corporate incomes taxes were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates.
3. SPF = Special Participation Fee.
4. Operating expenses and capital costs do not include the indirect taxation that may be applicable to these expenditures.
5. The estimated economic limit for the field occurs after the expiration date of the concession agreement. PRIO has represented that it expects to meet the conditions required by the ANP to obtain the concession extension. Based on this representation, and at PRIO's request, the reserves estimated herein considered the potential concession extension for the field.
6. PRIO has represented that a handling fee of U.S.$8.0 per barrel of oil is charged to the interest owners of the unitized reservoirs of the Albacora Leste field as a reimbursement for processing the hydrocarbons at the P-50 FPSO.

**Notes:**
1. At the request of PRIO, projections of the potential future from the net Reserves plus net Contingent Resources and Recategorized Recoverable Resources are presented herein for the Frade and Wahoo fields.
2. Application of any risk factor to contingent resources and recategorized recoverable resources quantities does not equate contingent resources or recategorized recoverable resources with reserves.
3. The contingent resources and recategorized recoverable resources evaluated herein have an economic status of Economically Viable. However, in order to reclassify contingent resources or recategorized recoverable resources as reserves, certain contingencies need to be resolved; therefore, there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent resources or recategorized recoverable resources evaluated herein.
4. SPF = Special Participation Fee.
5. Operating expenses and capital costs do not include the indirect taxation that may be applicable to these expenditures.
6. The estimated economic limit for the field occurs after the expiration date of the concession agreement. PRIO has represented that it expects to meet the conditions required by the ANP to obtain the concession extension. Based on this representation, and at PRIO's request, the reserves estimated herein considered the potential concession extension for the field.
7. Future social contribution taxes and corporate incomes taxes were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates.

**Notes:**
1. Probable reserves and values for probable reserves have not been risk adjusted to make them comparable to proved reserves and values for proved reserves.
2. At the request of PRIO, projections of the potential future from the net Reserves plus net Contingent Resources and Recategorized Recoverable Resources are presented herein for the Frade and Wahoo fields.
3. Application of any risk factor to contingent resources and recategorized recoverable resources quantities does not equate contingent resources or recategorized recoverable resources with reserves.
4. The contingent resources and recategorized recoverable resources evaluated herein have an economic status of Economically Viable. However, in order to reclassify contingent resources or recategorized recoverable resources as reserves, certain contingencies need to be resolved; therefore, there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent resources or recategorized recoverable resources evaluated herein.
5. SPF = Special Participation Fee.
6. Operating expenses and capital costs do not include the indirect taxation that may be applicable to these expenditures.
7. The estimated economic limit for the field occurs after the expiration date of the concession agreement. PRIO has represented that it expects to meet the conditions required by the ANP to obtain the concession extension. Based on this representation, and at PRIO's request, the reserves estimated herein considered the potential concession extension for the field.
8. Future social contribution taxes and corporate incomes taxes were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates.

**Present Worth (10³ U.S.$) at:**
- 5 Percent: 11,930,597
- 15 Percent: 7,129,837
- 20 Percent: 5,787,081

**Notes:**
1. Probable and possible reserves and values for probable and possible reserves have not been risk adjusted to make them comparable to proved reserves and values for proved reserves.
2. At the request of PRIO, projections of the potential future from the net Reserves plus net Contingent Resources and Recategorized Recoverable Resources are presented herein for the Frade and Wahoo fields.
3. Application of any risk factor to contingent resources and recategorized recoverable resources quantities does not equate contingent resources or recategorized recoverable resources with reserves.
4. The contingent resources and recategorized recoverable resources evaluated herein have an economic status of Economically Viable. However, in order to reclassify contingent resources or recategorized recoverable resources as reserves, certain contingencies need to be resolved; therefore, there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent resources or recategorized recoverable resources evaluated herein.
5. SPF = Special Participation Fee.
6. Operating expenses and capital costs do not include the indirect taxation that may be applicable to these expenditures.
7. The estimated economic limit for the field occurs after the expiration date of the concession agreement. PRIO has represented that it expects to meet the conditions required by the ANP to obtain the concession extension. Based on this representation, and at PRIO's request, the reserves estimated herein considered the potential concession extension for the field.
8. Future social contribution taxes and corporate incomes taxes were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates.
